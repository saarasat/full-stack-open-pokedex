## Exercise 11.1

In this fictional scenario, I choose Python as the language to take a closer look into. One of the most used linters for Python is pylint. For unit testing, Python has several different test runners, and some of the most popular ones out of these are unittest, nose (or nose2) and pytest. With Python, a common package manager is pip, that handles installing dependencies similarly as npm for JavaScript.  

What it comes to CI-tools, besides Jenkins and GitHub, Travis is a well-known tool in the industry. Few other of the common ones include CircleCI and GitLab. All in all, there are many tools for almost every single process, the developers just have to choose the ones that suit the situation the best. 

Just as with tool selection, the circumstances dictate which kind of CI environment should one choose; namely either cloud-based or self-hosted. In case of a large organization with multiple teams and projects using the CI/CD-pipelines a self-hosted environment might be the way to go. It gives the organization more room to customize the workflows as well a more complete control over the resources used. Self-hosted environments might also be worth it if there are special requirements regarding hardware in the deployment process. On the other hand, if the project and/or teams are small or new code is not deployed that often, cloud-based options might do the trick. Cloud-based solutions also have the benefit of the "pay-as-you-go" -model. So with cloud, there is no need to invest upfront in servers for the CI to use. The skills of the developers also might affect, cloud-based options such as GitHub Actions might be easier to adopt.
